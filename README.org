#+TITLE: auto-redirect-from-mobile-urls

firefox add-on to strip e.g. the ~.m.~ url component from ~en.m.wikipedia.org~ when on a desktop browser.

* Build
Run ~npm install . && cake bundle~.

* UX [0/5]
1. [-] by default, inspect the URL for any ~.m.~ component, and strip it if so.
   - [X] immediately redirecting to the stripped URL
   - /TODO: error handling if the new URL 404s???/
   - [ ] /TODO: research how to query the page content for any tags indicating that it is specifically mobile?/
   - [ ] /TODO: research other typical url renaming conventions commonly used on mobile sites?/
2. [ ] allow customizing a regex replacement mechanism for specific sites (matching the regex) in options
   - [ ] /TODO: determine if there is a standardized way that sites indicate where to fetch a non-mobile version of the same page?/
3. [ ] with a dropdown menu, allow adding a regex replacement table entry to the current page
   - [ ] /TODO: maybe default the regex to cover the *domain* instead of the full page url?/
4. [ ] vice versa if we are on a mobile browser (firefox for android supports some add-ons now!!)
5. [ ] publish to firefox add-ons: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension
